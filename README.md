# Discharge
Discharge is a game where you are constantly fighting off the darkness.

## Gameplay
Discharge is a real-time action game where your character, the Knight of Light, must fend off the Drain from obscuring the Sacred Generator. Discharge has a generator in the center of the screen, which generates power units, or ⚡. Once you reach 100⚡, you win.

There is a circle of darkness, known as the Drain, that is always getting smaller. If you are touching it, you are losing health. The rest of the land is gray, except for immediately around the Generator and any Lantern Conduits you place. If you are in the Drain, you take damage; if you are in the gray area, nothing happens; if you are in the light, you heal.

Discharge has a collection of powerups. These include:
- Illumination Strike (drives away darkness in small area)
- Static Shield (invincibility)
- Shining Grace (heal)
- Overcharge (kill one enemy)
These powerups can be found on the map (a finite number are procedurally generated at the beginning) or can be bought using ⚡.

Discharge also has 'buildings' that can be bought for ⚡ and placed. These include:
- Lantern Conduits (light up an area, cannot be used to 'protect' the Generator)
- Auxiliary Generators (produce additional ⚡, doesn't matter what happens to them in win/loss consideration)
- Shock Coils (damage nearby enemies, light up when attacking, attacks are ~0.5s, ~5s between attacks
There is also one building that can be found, but not bought. This is the Plasma-Imbued Multi-Cell Battery Unit (PLIMUCBU). When found in the environment, the player can absorb ⚡ from them and add it to their total
